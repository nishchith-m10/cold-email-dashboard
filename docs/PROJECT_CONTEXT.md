## 🎯 Project Overview

**What is this?**  
A Next.js dashboard that tracks cold email campaign performance and LLM costs for an n8n-powered outreach system.

**Who is it for?**  
Nishchith @ Smartie Agents - an AI automation agency doing cold email outreach.

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: Next.js 14, React, Tailwind CSS, Recharts
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL), Google Sheets API
- Automation: n8n workflows
- Hosting: Vercel
- LLMs: OpenAI (o3-mini, GPT-4o), Anthropic (Claude Sonnet 4.5)

---

## ✅ Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Email Event Tracking ✅
- Historical data backfill (486 emails imported)
- Real-time tracking for Email 1, 2, 3 workflows
- Opt-out tracking
- Supabase `email_events` table

### Phase 2: LLM Cost Tracking (100% Accurate) ✅
- Replaced LangChain nodes with HTTP Request nodes for exact token counts
- Services tracked:
  | Provider | Model | Tracking Method |
  |----------|-------|-----------------|
  | Relevance AI | LinkedIn Research | API run history (100%) |
  | Google CSE | Custom Search | Fixed pricing ($0.005/query) |
  | OpenAI | o3-mini | HTTP Request (100%) |
  | OpenAI | GPT-4o | HTTP Request (100%) |
  | Anthropic | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | HTTP Request (100%) |
  | Apify | Google Reviews | Compute units (~90%) |
- Cost events stored in Supabase `llm_usage` table
- Webhook endpoint: `/api/cost-events`

### Phase 3: Dashboard UI ✅
- Overview page with key metrics
- Analytics page with:
  - Daily LLM Cost chart (with timezone support)
  - Cost by provider breakdown
  - Cost by purpose breakdown
- Timezone selector (synced to localStorage)
- Ask AI feature for natural language queries
- Date range picker

### Phase 6: Production Deployment ✅
- Deployed to Vercel: `https://cold-email-dashboard.vercel.app`
- GitHub repo: `https://github.com/nishchith-m1015/cold-email-dashboard`
- Environment variables configured
- All 7 n8n workflows updated with Vercel URL

### Bug Fixes & Optimizations ✅
- Fixed date timezone shifts in charts
- Fixed Y-axis label cutoff
- Implemented fuzzy model name matching for pricing
- Added provider colors for all services
- Server-side caching (5-min TTL) for Google Sheets data
- Cache management in Settings dropdown

---

### Phase 4: Reply Rate Tracking ✅
**Goal:** Track when prospects reply to emails

**Implementation:**
- Created Gmail Trigger workflow (`Reply Tracker.json`)
- Detects new emails, matches sender to known leads
- Logs `replied` events to Supabase
- Updates lead status in Google Sheets

### Phase 5: Click Rate Tracking ✅
**Goal:** Track when prospects click links in emails

**Implementation:**
- `/api/track/open` - Tracking pixel endpoint (1x1 GIF)
- `/api/track/click` - Link redirect endpoint with logging
- `Email Tracking Injector.json` - n8n code node to inject tracking into emails
- Click rate displayed on Overview dashboard
- Time series chart for click trends

---

## ⏳ Pending Phases

### Phase 8: Advanced Caching Strategy
- React Query / SWR optimization
- LocalStorage persistence  
- Optimistic UI updates

### Phase 9+: Optional Enhancements
- Custom domain configuration
- Clerk authentication
- Migrate Google Sheets → PostgreSQL

### Phase 6b: Performance Optimization (Completed) ✅
**Goal:** Fix slow page reloads and navigation lag.
**Implementation:**
- **Aggregate API:** Created `/api/dashboard/aggregate` to fetch Summary, Timeseries, Cost, and Campaigns in a single server-side parallel request.
- **Client Caching:** Updated `useDashboardData` to use SWR with `keepPreviousData: true`.
- **Global Config:** Configured `lib/swr-config.tsx` with a 10s deduplication interval to prevent redundant fetches on tab switching.
- **Outcome:** Initial load is batched; Navigation between Overview/Analytics is instant (reading from cache).

### Phase 7: Database Materialization ✅
**Goal:** Pre-calculate aggregations for 10-30x faster queries.

**Implementation:**
- **Materialized Views:** Created `mv_daily_stats` and `mv_llm_cost` views
  - `mv_daily_stats`: Pre-aggregates email events by day/campaign/workspace
  - `mv_llm_cost`: Pre-aggregates LLM costs by day/provider/model/workspace
- **Migration:** `supabase/migrations/20251207000002_materialized_views.sql`
  - Includes unique indexes for CONCURRENT refresh
  - Performance indexes on common query patterns
- **Refresh Logic:** Admin API endpoint `/api/admin/refresh-views`
  - Secured with `MATERIALIZED_VIEWS_REFRESH_TOKEN`
  - Configured as Vercel cron job (daily at midnight)
- **API Refactor:** Updated `/api/dashboard/aggregate` to use views exclusively
  - Eliminated all raw table scans
  - Added workspace isolation (`workspace_id` filtering)
  - Implemented case-insensitive campaign filtering with `ilike()`
- **Data Fixes:** 
  - Discovered database uses `step` column (not `email_number`)
  - Fixed materialized view to use correct column
  - Campaign dropdown now populated correctly

**Outcome:** 
- API response time: ~800ms → <100ms (10-30x improvement)
- Dashboard loads near-instantly
- Campaign filtering works correctly
- "Contacts Reached" metric accurate

## 📝 n8n Workflow Notes

### Cost Tracking Flow:
1. `💰 Init Cost Tracking` - Initialize `_cost_events` array
2. Each service adds its cost to the array
3. `📊 Send Cost Events to Dashboard` - POST to Vercel API
4. Dashboard displays in real-time

### Webhook URL for all workflows:
```
https://cold-email-dashboard.vercel.app/api/cost-events
```

### Token header:
```
x-webhook-token: 6de5a8d03ad6348f4110782372a82f1bb7c6ef43a8ce8810bf0459e73abaeb61
```

---

## 🐛 Known Issues / Troubleshooting

1. **Costs not showing?** Check Supabase `llm_usage` table directly
2. **Dashboard slow?** Clear cache via Settings → Clear cache & refresh
3. **n8n webhook fails?** Verify the Vercel URL and token header
4. **Charts empty?** Check date range picker - data might be outside range
